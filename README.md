# Paste into codeblock

This little Obsidian plugin gives the possibility to paste directly inside a code block.

By default the hotkey `Ctrl + Alt + V` is assigned, but can be configured in the Hotkeys settings.

It's also possible to select a default language for posting, inside the configuration menu.

The source code is heavily based on: https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-url-into-selection

# Installation
In order to install this plugin, go to "Settings > Third Party Plugins > Paste into codeblock".
